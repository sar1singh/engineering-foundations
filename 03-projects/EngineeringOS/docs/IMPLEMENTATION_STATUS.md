# EngineeringOS Implementation Status

## Completed Phases

- Phase 1: Project initialization with Next.js, TypeScript, App Router, TailwindCSS, ESLint, and `src`.
- Phase 2: App shell with sidebar, header, and route structure.
- Phase 3: Core TypeScript types for roadmap, content, practice, problems, references, evaluation, and progress.
- Phase 4: Structured mock content with one active roadmap, 18 domains, and 20+ seeded topics.
- Phase 5: Repository interfaces for roadmap, topic, practice, problem, references, progress, questions, prompts, and rubrics.
- Phase 6: Mock repository implementations using `src/data`.
- Phase 7: Content aggregation services.
- Phase 8: Service-backed UI pages for dashboard, graph, topic studio, practice lab, progress, and content search.
- Phase 9: Backend-ready placeholder architecture and centralized mock service wiring.
- Phase 10: Quality pass for empty states, type safety, routes, and responsive layout.
- Phase 11: Documentation and progress update.
- Phase 12: Local Prisma + SQLite schema, migration SQL, seed script, Prisma client helper, and Prisma repository implementations.
- Phase 13: Opt-in Prisma data source wiring, safe mock fallback defaults, and read-only UI verification.

## Current Features

- `/` redirects to `/dashboard`.
- `/dashboard` shows mission, current topic, readiness, revision queue, weak areas, and current learning path.
- `/graph` renders the roadmap tree from `RoadmapTreeService`.
- `/topics/[topicId]` renders full topic content from `TopicContentService`.
- `/practice/[taskId]` renders task details from `PracticeContentService`.
- `/progress` renders local progress summary from `ProgressSummaryService`.
- `/content` searches mock roadmaps, topics, tasks, and references.
- `/settings` shows app config and disabled feature flags.

## Current Architecture

The active data path is:

```txt
Page
  -> appServices
    -> Service
      -> Repository Interface
        -> Mock Repository or Prisma Repository
          -> Mock Data or local SQLite
```

`appServices` resolves the repository implementation from `appConfig.dataSource`. The default remains `mock`; Prisma mode is opt-in only through the local public env value `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENGINEERINGOS_DATA_SOURCE=prisma`.

Backend-ready layers now exist for:

- `src/lib/config`
- `src/lib/auth`
- `src/lib/db`
- `src/lib/repositories`
- `src/lib/services`
- `src/lib/storage`
- `src/lib/evaluation`
- `src/lib/ai`
- `src/lib/providers`

## Data Layer Status

- Active data source: `mock`
- Prisma: local SQLite schema and repositories implemented, wired for opt-in read-only local mode
- Supabase: not implemented
- Real AI: not implemented
- Auth: disabled mock abstraction only
- DB: disabled mock abstraction only
- Storage: in-memory mock abstraction only
- Progress: still local/mock-backed in Prisma mode; no Prisma progress writes yet

## Known Gaps

- Prisma `migrate dev` hit a generic local schema-engine error on this Windows/Node setup, so the migration SQL was generated with Prisma diff and applied locally with `prisma db execute`.
- Prisma mode is read-only in Phase 13. If a Prisma read fails, repository provider fallbacks return safe null or empty collection responses so pages can show empty states instead of crashing.
- No real code execution engine yet.
- No real AI evaluation yet.
- No user accounts or cloud progress yet.
- Mock content is representative, not complete curriculum-grade content.

## Next Phase Recommendation

The next phase should be Phase 14: Prisma Write/Persistence Planning, only after explicit approval. Supabase planning should remain a separate future phase and should not be combined with local Prisma write planning.
