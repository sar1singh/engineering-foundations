# Engineering Foundations
### Principal Engineer / Solution Architect Mastery System

This repository is a **long-term engineering knowledge system** designed to take an engineer from fundamentals to **Senior / Principal Engineer or Solution Architect level**.

This is **not** a tutorial dump.
This is **not** a LeetCode-only repo.
This is a **thinking system** for:
- problem solving
- system design
- cloud architecture
- communication
- career growth

The goal is **interview readiness + on-the-job excellence**, not short-term cramming.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Build **deep fundamentals** that never expire
- Convert learning into **portfolio artifacts**
- Develop **principal-level judgment**
- Prepare for **global interviews (FAANG / top product companies)**
- Support **long-term career growth and promotions**

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

### Core Principles
- One topic = one file
- Empty file = not covered yet
- Filled file = understood and practiced
- README files = summaries and mental models
- Notes = reflections, not copy-paste theory

You don’t “finish” this repo.
You **grow with it**.

## 🧠 PRINCIPAL ENGINEER READINESS AUDIT (SELF-CHECK)

Use this section **monthly** or before interviews.

### A. Technical Depth
You are principal-ready if you can:
- Explain JS event loop and async behavior clearly
- Debug memory leaks and performance issues
- Explain trade-offs between data structures
- Design systems starting from requirements, not tools

**Red flags**
- Tool-first thinking
- Buzzword-heavy explanations
- Panic during open-ended problems

---

### B. DSA & Algorithms
You are ready if:
- You can classify problems into patterns quickly
- You explain *why* a solution works
- You defend data structure choices
- You stay calm with LeetCode mediums

Score yourself (1–5): ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

---

### C. System Design
You are ready if:
- You clarify requirements explicitly
- You discuss failure modes early
- You mention cost and operability naturally
- You avoid premature microservices

Score yourself (1–5): ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

---

### D. Cloud & Distributed Systems
You are ready if:
- You understand limits, quotas, and costs
- You can design without managed services
- You justify managed services anyway
- You compare AWS vs GCP vs Azure conceptually

Score yourself (1–5): ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

---

### E. Communication & Leadership
You are ready if:
- You explain systems to juniors and executives
- You disagree calmly with data
- You summarize designs in 5 bullet points
- You focus on impact, not effort

Score yourself (1–5): ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

---

### F. Career & Impact
You are ready if:
- You understand promotion mechanics
- You quantify your impact
- You create leverage for other engineers
- You document decisions proactively

Score yourself (1–5): ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

- “Why should we level you as principal?”

Expectation:
- System-level thinking
- Ownership
- Measurable outcomes

---

### Certifications (`18-certifications/`)
Architecture questions:
- “You have AWS certs. Design this system.”
- “What are the limits of this service?”
